while testing my grammar file with testRig, I noticed some of the samples don't follow the rule I set.
For instance:
1. Function doesn't contain return statement
2. if doesn't have exist at the end or the else statement
3. Forget to end some statement with semi-colon
4. Remove multi-lines comments and only allow single-line comments
